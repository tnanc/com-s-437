*Author: Tucker Nance (nancet)*

*Instructor: James Lathrop*

As a Cadet-in-training for the Universal Space Exploration Federation, you must become acquainted with the one thing that will stay by your side: your ship--designed to be simplistic and controlled with but a thought. you must face your three training sequences before you can graduate and become an official Cadet. Good luck!

## Controls
Use the mouse to point the ship in the x/y direction.

Toggle CAPSLOCK to pause the game and the timer.

Hold the spacebar to activate thrusters. Hold left-shift in unison to move backwards.

Hold left-ctrl to overclock the thrusters, providing a brief speed boost.

### Precision Control
For more accurate direction control, use:

W/S to control pitch,

A/D to control yaw,

Q/E to control roll.

## Objective
There are three levels, each with their own target time. You must reach the finish line in time to earn full credit.

Skipping the active ring (lit light blue) adds 10 seconds to your time for each skipped ring.

Gain 3 stars from each level, 9 stars in total, to graduate to Cadet status.
