# INSTRUCTIONS
1. Aiming
	- Aim with your mouse cursor
	- The ball is directed from its position toward the cursor
	- The further from the ball, the faster it goes

2. Strength
	- Strength changes the amount of time before drag slows the ball
	- Use the scroll wheel to increase/decrease strength

3. Obstacles
	- A large rock blocks your path, try to avoid it
	- Don't hit the ball too hard, or it might go into the water
	- Light to dark gradients are downhill slopes
	- Dark to light gradients are uphill slopes
		- If you go uphill fast enough, you might be able to jump the water
